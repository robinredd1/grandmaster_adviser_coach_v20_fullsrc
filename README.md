# Grandmaster Advisor‑Coach v20 — Premarket Quick Wins + Core (No Auto‑Trading)

**Turn it on in the morning** to see:
- **Quick Wins** (premarket gappers still trending up): exact **Buy ≤ limit**, **share size**, **stop**, **trailing %**, **first target**.
- **Core leaders** (NVDA/AAPL/etc.) when momentum is positive.

## Run on Replit
1) Create a new Repl → upload these files or Import from GitHub → click **Run**.
2) The dashboard auto-refreshes every ~2s.
3) No orders are placed automatically; you place them in your broker.

> **Security note:** This package has your API keys in `config.py`. Keep the GitHub repo **PRIVATE**, or remove keys and use Replit Secrets.
